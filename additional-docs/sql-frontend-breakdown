# Frontend Overview

The SpringQueuePro frontend is a **React + TypeScript dashboard** designed to surface the internal behavior of a production-grade task processing system in a clear, observable, and recruiter-friendly way. Rather than acting as a generic CRUD UI (like the interfaces for my SpringQueue (base) and GoQueue projects), each page highlights a specific system concern: authentication, task lifecycle, processing behavior, and operational health.

---

## Authentication & Application Shell

### **AuthContext.tsx**

This file is the **core of the frontend authentication system**.

`AuthContext` centralizes:

* JWT access + refresh token storage
* Session restoration on page reload
* Automatic access token refresh
* Logout and refresh token invalidation
* A shared authentication contract (`useAuth`) for the entire app

By wrapping the application in `AuthProvider`, authentication state and logic are **defined once** and consumed everywhere, avoiding prop drilling and duplicated token logic. This design also makes route protection and API authorization predictable and robust.

---

### **ProtectedRoute.tsx**

A lightweight route guard that:

* Blocks access to protected pages if the user is not authenticated
* Redirects unauthenticated users to the login flow

This ensures the dashboard reflects real-world authorization boundaries.

---

### **App.tsx**

Defines the application’s routing structure and access model:

* Public routes (Login, Register, About)
* Protected routes (Tasks, Dashboards, Metrics, Processing)
* A default route that redirects users based on authentication state

It acts as the **entry point and security boundary** for the frontend.

---

### **NavBar.tsx**

The primary navigation surface for authenticated users.
It provides quick access to all operational dashboards and reflects the authenticated state of the application.

---

## Authentication Entry & Visibility

### **LoginPage.tsx**

Handles user authentication and session initiation.
On successful login, users are redirected into the authenticated dashboard flow. It also provides a public link to the About page for unauthenticated visitors.

---

### **RegisterPage.tsx**

Handles account creation and initial onboarding.
After registration, users are directed back into the login flow. Like the Login page, it allows access to the About page without authentication.

---

### **TokenDashboardPage.tsx**

Provides a **high-level view of the authentication pipeline**, including token presence, expiry, refresh behavior, and overall session state.

This page exists primarily as:

* A transparency and debugging tool
* A way to showcase JWT-based auth mechanics
* A visual explanation of how authentication behaves “under the hood”

> **Note on Token Rotation History**
>
> This page also includes a small, client-side visualization of refresh token rotation events to help
> demonstrate how the authentication pipeline behaves in practice (JWT expiry, refresh, and Redis-backed
> invalidation). This rotation history is **purely diagnostic and cosmetic**, scoped to the current user
> session, and cleared on logout.
>
> It is not security-critical or authoritative, and is intentionally implemented client-side to avoid
> adding backend complexity for a non-essential observability feature. In a production setting, this could
> be backed by a user-scoped audit table if long-term persistence were required.

---

## Task Interaction & Observability

### **TasksPage.tsx**

The **task submission interface**.

This page focuses on:

* Creating tasks via GraphQL
* Selecting valid task types from dynamically loaded enums
* Viewing the exact GraphQL mutation used
* Inspecting the backend response
* Seeing recently created tasks and retrying failures

It intentionally keeps observability minimal, emphasizing **task creation mechanics** rather than system-wide inspection.

---

### **TasksDashboardPage.tsx**

The **deep introspection view** for task lifecycle management.

This page provides:

* A full task table with filtering and search
* Live task status updates
* Retry and deletion controls
* A safe, read-only GraphQL explorer
* Drill-down inspection via a detail drawer

This dashboard is designed to feel closer to an internal operator or SRE tool than a traditional CRUD interface.

---

### **TaskDetailDrawer.tsx**

A stateless, presentational UI component used by the Tasks Dashboard.

It slides in from the side and displays:

* The GraphQL query used to fetch a task
* The full task JSON payload
* A simple close interaction

It contains no business logic and exists purely to support task inspection.

---

## Runtime & Operational Visibility

### **ProcessingMonitorPage.tsx**

Visualizes **live processing behavior** within the system.

This page surfaces:

* Worker pool activity (active, idle, in-flight)
* Queue depth
* Completed and failed task counts
* A rolling stream of processing events

It helps demonstrate concurrency, throughput, and real-time system behavior.

---

### **SystemHealthPage.tsx**

Displays operational health information from Spring Boot Actuator.

This includes:

* Overall system health
* Component-level status (database, Redis, etc.)
* Key runtime metrics
* Periodic polling with manual refresh support

The page exists to showcase **production readiness and observability**, not just application correctness.

---

## Informational Pages

### **AboutPage.tsx**

A public-facing overview of the SpringQueuePro project.

This page:

* Is accessible with or without authentication
* Adjusts navigation based on auth state
* Explains system goals, architecture, and capabilities
* Acts as a portfolio and project summary page

It is intentionally non-operational and informational.

---

## Summary

The frontend is structured to reflect **real production concerns**:

* Authentication and authorization
* Task submission vs task inspection
* Processing behavior and concurrency
* Health, metrics, and observability

Rather than hiding system internals, the UI surfaces them deliberately—making the application both a functional dashboard and a technical demonstration.
