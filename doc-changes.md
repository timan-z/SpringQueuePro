Stylistic Changes to my README (maybe):

- Should maybe move the "**Why the SpringQueue-*Pro***" section somewhere near the bottom (near the misc stuff) instead of directly under the **Overview** section. Instead I can maybe just reference inside the **Overview** section that "this project builds upon an earlier one" and then have that re-direct to the "**Why the SpringQueue-*Pro***" section later down in the project.
